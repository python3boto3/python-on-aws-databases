aws database and s3 data transfers moved by python: pep-8 examples 

This is an ongoing project aimed at showcasing connectivity and transfer of data to nine AWS database types. 
All of the files are python based, utilizing fragments from previous data pipeline projects. 
These include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Aurora, Athena, DynamoDB, Redshift, SQL Server and Oracle. 
The aim of the project is to create 9 methods which are all bucket triggered.
This will create a WORM response, re-purposing the data and uploading each data cut to all 9 different types of database.
