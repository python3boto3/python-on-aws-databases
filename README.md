# python-on-aws-databases
aws database and s3 data transfers moved by python: pep-8 examples 

This is an ongoing project aimed at connectivity and transfer of data to and from csv files in nine AWS databases. 
All of the files are python or py-boto3 based, and utilize many previous fragments from data pipeline projects. 
These include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Aurora, Athena, Aurora, DynamoDB, Redshift, SQL Server and Oracle. 
The aim of the project is to create 9 methods which are all bucket triggered.
This will create a WORM response, re-purposing the data nine times, and uploading the data to all 9 databases.
